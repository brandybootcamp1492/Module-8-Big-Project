# Vehicle Creation Application

In this application, users can create different types of vehicles using the command line. These vehicles include cars, trucks, and motorbikes.   Users can perform actions using the vehicles. These actions include printing details, towing vehicles, and performing stunts like wheelies.


## Description

The **Vehicle Builder CLI Application** demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts using TypeScript. It includes:
- Inheritance: Classes like `Car`, `Truck`, and `Motorbike` inherit attributes from the `Vehicle` class.
- Polymorphism: Shared methods like `printDetails` perform different actions based on the subclass.
- Interfaces: Interfaces can determine the structure of functions, classes, or objects.  For example, the `Truck` class implements an `AbleToTow` interface.
  
Users can create vehicles, select existing ones, and perform actions unique to each type of vehicle.
